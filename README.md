<h1>Key Features of webRtc-ytx:</h1>

<br>

> [!CAUTION]

<br>

> [!NOTE]
>
> <h4>Seamless Camera Switching On Mobile🤳🏻</h4>
> <ul>
> <li> During a live call, users can switch their camera without any interruptions based on their devices, allowing for a flexible and smooth experience.
> </li></ul>
> <h4>Call Control Options 🔇 </h4>
> <ul>
> <li>Users have the ability to mute themselves or disconnect from the call at any time, giving them full control over their communication.</li>
> </ul>
> <h4>Reconnection Support 🚪</h4>
> <ul>
> <li>If a user disconnects, they can easily rejoin the room. Simply send a request to rejoin, and once approved by the connected peer, the communication can resume without any disruption.</li>
> </ul>

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Each user has the <kbd>reload stream</kbd> option available in their chat room, which enables both users to connect for real-time communication. In case the stream doesn't load, use the above option.
>
> The repo contains two directories, <kbd>client</kbd> and <kbd>server</kbd>, and you can use the project by installing the npm packages in both of the respective directories.
